# What is this ? and Why ?

This repo is about the work of Cl√©ment BOTTY and Nathan TERRADE on the [German traffic signs recognition dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign).   
This comes from our TX project at UTC on autonomous driving. 

These scripts are designed to work with the dataset architecture. You can find the dataset on the internet and download it. 

Then, with these scripts, you will be able to work with the dataset and convert everything into a dataset that can be read and used by YoloV5.

# How it works

## UPDATE

I've created a very simple shell script that does everything for you (assuming that you already have downloaded the dataset)  
Make sure you are in a python venv, otherwise the script will install the dependencies globally.   
Just make sure you have the right to execute the script and then run `work.sh` :)

The following is just for you if you want to better understand what's going on. 

## First step 

Working fine Python 3.9.9, not tested with previous versions.  

Ugly files with redondant code but it works fine :)

- download scikit-learn

- download natsort

- use the scripts that convert CSV file into XML (`csv_to_xml_for_test.py` and `csv_to_xml_for_train.py`)  
Those will create 2 new folders : `test_xmls` and `train_xmls`

## Second step

Now you have successfully converted the data from the CSV files into specific XML file. 

Then, you need to convert those XML files into readable files for YoloV5. 

For that, you have 2 new scripts : `test_xmls_to_yolo_format.py` and  `train_xmls_to_yolo_format.py`

When you run those files, if everything worked correctly a random image with her annotation will be ploted. 

## Third step

All you have to do now, is split the dataset accordingly with the format that yolo want.   

- Create a folder named `images_` and copy all the images from the dataset (located in `Test` and in every `Train/x` folder) into that folder

- Create a folder named `annotations_` and copy all the labels into it  

- Create all the architecture needed for YoloV5

Run the following script to do so `split_dataset.py`
